# derangedium

A [deutexrium](https://github.com/portasynthinca3/deuterium) fork, a Discord bot that automatically generates messages based on the previously seen ones on a per-channel basis.

## Use an existing one
This bot is currently not for public used and is only used on private servers by requested deployment. You can gladly try deutexrium until this one is updated enough.

## TODO
  - bring back `/forget`
  - bring back `/export`
  - refactor fucking everything (i have never written a single line of elixir)
  - fix link removal when mentions are disabled
